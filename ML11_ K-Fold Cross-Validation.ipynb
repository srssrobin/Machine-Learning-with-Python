K-Fold Cross-Validation (CV)**\n","\n","K-fold Cross-Validation (CV) is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model by dividing the dataset into **K-equally sized Subsets/Fold**. In each iteration, one fold is used for testing, while the remaining K-1 folds are used for training. This process is repeated K times, with each fold serving as a test set exactly once. The results from all iterations are then averaged to provide a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.\n","\n","K-fold CV helps reduce the risk of overfitting and provides a better generalization of the model on unseen data.\n","\n","The choice of K is an important factor in K-fold CV. Typically, K is set between 5 or 10, though it can vary depending on the dataset size. A higher K requires a more accurate estimate of model performance but requires more comptation. One common variation is **Stratified K-Fold** where the data is split in such a way that the class distribution remains consistent across all folds, which is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.\n","\n","## **Pseudo-Code for K-Fold Cross Validation:**\n","\n","1. Split the dataset into **K** equally sized folds.\n","\n","2. For each fold (i from 1 to K): \\\n","\n","    a. Set i-th fold as the **test** set. \\\n","    b. Combine the remaining **K-1** folds as the **training** set. \\\n","    c. Train the model on the training set.\\\n","    d. Evaluate the model on the test set, and record the performance metric. \\\n","\n","3.
